# IT Goals for 2020 and Beyond

Happy new year everyone! I thought it would be cool for me to start the new year with a blog post about some of my goals. This one will be primarily focused on Information technology(IT). Recently I have decided to pursue cloud over information security. The reason for this is because I did not have fun learning about pentesting or even doing pentesting. So far I have been having fun learning about AWS and setting up some basic projects. Not only am I enjoying cloud a lot more but there are a lot more opportunities for employment in my area.

A lot of my goals for this year are geared towards breaking into the cloud field and starting a career there. This year I am going to earn four certifications, which are:

-   Certified Solutions Architect Associate (CSAA)
-   Certified Developer Associate (CDA)
-   Certified Sysops Administrator Associate (CSysOpsAA)
-   Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator(RHCSA)

I took my certified solutions architect associate exam two days ago and I passed! I am going to upload a different video and write a blog post dedicated to my experience studying for, and taking the exam.

With one exam down that leaves three to go. I plan to have the other two AWS certifications by the middle of February. After that I am going to start working on some projects to help bolster my resume. Having a lot of intermediate level certifications on your resume is cool but being able to talk about some of the things you are able to do is a lot better. The project I am most interested in doing is the cloud administrator roadmap that was posted to Reddit a while back. Iâ€™ll make sure to include it in this blog post. I have also found a helpful discord as well. Talking and reading articles about the technology has really helped me grasp what is being taught to me.

Some of you might be following my journey as a help desk technician but fortunately that journey should be coming to an end soon. I plan to leave my job by my one year mark, which is in May. I have learned a lot about the corporate environment and corporate IT from working here but I really would like to move onto somewhere new so I can start making enough money to pay off my student loans.

The first half of 2020 will be spent gaining certifications will the last half will be spent working and developing my skills as a cloud administrator. Hopefully you guys will be there as I start and end my journey. Thanks for reading!
