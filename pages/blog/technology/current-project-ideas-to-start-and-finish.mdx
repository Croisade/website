# Projects to start work on, and finish

### Pomodoro App

A terminal based application, that reminds the user to take a break every 25 minutes, with 5 minute break intervals. I want this to be my first "real" Haskell project. It should be pretty simple to do and I don't think I've seen a solution to this problem on github. I've only seen pomodoro apps in the browser.

Only question I have is can the terminal play sounds?

### WhatYouWant App

You type in your zip code, range, category of food that you're in the mood for. Makes a api call to yelp that selects a random restaurant from a list of restaurants.

* react
* typescript
* redux?

### Flash card App plugins

Automatic spanish word importer(ASWI)

I want an extension on my browser that allows me to automatically import spanish word with their translations, example, Type(verb, noun), into my anki flash deck

This does not have to be a browser extension but could also live on the anki app itself, all I would have to do is type in a word into my app and it gets imported.

### Productivity extension

A browser extension that blocks websites during certain hours of the day to prevent people like me from getting side tracked when working on projects.

I'd prefer to use Haskell for this but, I'd probably end up using Typescript.
