# Day One - HackerRank 30 days of code

I need different ways to practice my skills with Haskell so I thought the 30 days of code challenge from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard) would be a good start. So far so good. Sometimes I have issues with their scaffolding but other then that I have no complaints. Expect a solution for each day. If there are some problems that can not be done in haskell then I will post the solution in javascript or typescript.

## Solution

```haskell
import System.IO

main :: IO ()
main = do
  variable <- getLine
  putStrLn "Hello, World"
  putStrLn variable
```

export default ({ children }) => <BlogLayout meta={meta}>{children}</BlogLayout>
