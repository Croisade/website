# Day Two - HackerRank 30 days of code

I need different ways to practice my skills with Haskell so I thought the 30 days of code challenge from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard) would be a good start.

This was my first time dealing with IO in Haskell. I haven't gone over monads or IO much at this point and it took me a while to figure out what I can and can not do within a `do` syntax. If I want to bind a some data to a variable, the data has to have a IO context. In the case below read returns data within IO. Atleast this is how I understand it at this point and time as I write this blog post. The problem itself was straight forward. Calculate how much the bill would be for a meal after tip and tax. I dot think all of these imports are necessary but they are from the boilerplate code provided by hackerRank.

## Solution

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE DuplicateRecordFields, FlexibleInstances, UndecidableInstances #-}

module Main where

import Control.Monad
import Data.Array
import Data.Bits
import Data.List
import Data.List.Split
import Data.Set
import Data.Text
import Debug.Trace
import System.Environment
import System.IO
import System.IO.Unsafe
import GHC.Float.RealFracMethods

--
-- Complete the 'solve' function below.
--
-- The function accepts following parameters:
--  1. DOUBLE meal_cost
--  2. INTEGER tip_percent
--  3. INTEGER tax_percent
--

solve :: Double -> Int -> Int -> IO ()
solve meal_cost tip_percent tax_percent = do
    -- Write your code here
    print (roundDoubleInt $ meal_cost + ((meal_cost / 100) * fromIntegral tip_percent) + ((fromIntegral tax_percent / 100) * meal_cost))


lstrip = Data.Text.unpack . Data.Text.stripStart . Data.Text.pack
rstrip = Data.Text.unpack . Data.Text.stripEnd . Data.Text.pack

main :: IO()
main = do
    meal_costTemp <- getLine
    let meal_cost = read $ lstrip $ rstrip meal_costTemp :: Double

    tip_percentTemp <- getLine
    let tip_percent = read $ lstrip $ rstrip tip_percentTemp :: Int

    tax_percentTemp <- getLine
    let tax_percent = read $ lstrip $ rstrip tax_percentTemp :: Int

    solve meal_cost tip_percent tax_percent
```
