# RunFast Pro Weighted Vest Review - RunMax

Iâ€™ve recently just picked up the Runmax RunFast pro weighted vest for 36 dollars on Amazon here. So far I am very impressed with the product. The Runmax RunFast pro weighted vest is not considered the best weighted vest but, in my opinion, it does the job very well.

I purchased a weighted vest to help with my body weight training. If you are new to the blog or my youtube channel I do a lot of push ups, dips, pull ups. After a while the exercises start to become too easy. Unlike traditional resistance training I can not just add 5lbs to my barbell. This is where the weighted vest helps. With this vest I am able to increase the resistance and continue to build muscle.

Some of the things I like about the Runmax RunFast pro weighted vest is that it has a water bottle holder. The water bottle holder can also double as a phone holder instead. In the beginning of the video you can see me using this functionality when doing pull ups. The weighted vest does not put any stress on my shoulders at 20lbs, so I do not need the shoulder pads as of yet. The best part about this vest is that you can add more weight to it if you choose to. I plan to fill up pouches of sand to increase the weight when I become stronger.

There are some bad aspects of this weighted vest. The shoulder pads that they provide to you are a little flimsy and light. It is almost not worth the extra money since you could probably make your own and be more successful. Unlike the Mir vest, the Runmax RunFast pro weighted vest is a little long. When you do exercises like pushups it might start drooping to the ground.

Overall I would definitely recommend this vest to anyone who runs or does calisthenics. I have been using it for a while already and I can definitely see some gains.
