# Persistent Ankle Issues

I started running about three months ago using the [couch to 5k program](http://www.c25k.com/) I found online. At first everything was fine, but towards week five it demanded that I ran 2 miles in 20 minutes. The issue with this is that I have been doing the entire program on 5 mph for five weeks. To run one mile in 10 minutes it requires me to run at 6 mph. My body was definitely not ready for the change in pace.

To give some context I have not ran seriously in almost 3 years and I thought the couch to 5k program would be perfect for me but it was not. Right now I am experiencing pain in both my ankles when running. The pain is only there at the start, about the first 7 minutes or so and then it starts to subside but it is still there in the background. I have started using a foam rollers on my calves, inner thighs and doing ankle rolls for my warm up and that helped a little bit, but not enough. Before every run I do a five minute warm up, which is 2 minutes of brisk walking and 3 minutes of running at 5 mph. Even with all this I am still feeling pain in my ankle.

Right now I am considering seeing a physical therapist in two months if things do not get better from here. A ankle brace should help so I purchased one on Amazon. Even with all the issues I am experiencing I am still seeing progress. My heart is a lot stronger, I do not feel winded when running, ever, and I am seeing some growth in my leg muscles. I hope to give an update on my ankles within 2 to 3 months. Thanks for reading.
