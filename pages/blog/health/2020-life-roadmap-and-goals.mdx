# 2020 Life Roadmap & Goals

Happy New Year everyone! I thought that it would be a great idea to write a blog post and make a video about my goals for 2020. Which is why I have named this post “2020 Life Roadmap & Goals”. I have decided that it would be better for me to make separate posts and videos for my IT goals. For now, I will keep everything else here.

If you have been following me on my blog or my YouTube you have probably noticed that I am very inconsistent when it comes to uploading or even just putting out content. In the past I would say things like “I will be uploading at least three times a week” and then I would never do it. I would either get caught up in studying or I would be too lazy to turn on my camera and talk to it for five minutes. Three videos a day was way too aggressive for me, especially in the beginning when I am not even getting paid.

I think a more reasonable goal is to upload at least once a week, and preferably on a schedule. This will allow me to record videos in batches and I can use YouTube scheduled publish. This is probably what I am going to be doing, at least at the start.

I recognize that there is no overarching theme to the videos that I upload to Youtube and that probably will not change. My vision for my Youtube channel was to have a place where I can upload videos about anything, for any topic. I just want to express myself. I know that hurts me since I have no specialty but I am okay with that. People do not have to watch every single video I put out. I am perfectly fine with people watching whatever fancies them.

Another goal that I have is to obtain my hunting license. Some of you may have known that I wanted to learn how to hunt from my previous video about the perception of hunting in the black community. This year I plan to start. In fact, this weekend I will be going to a gun range to shoot a gun for the first time. I am very excited.

Not only do I want to go hunting with a muzzleloader rifle, but I also want to try bow hunting too. I know bow hunting is a lot more difficult but you have so much more time during the hunting season. In New Jersey you are only allowed to use a muzzleloader rifle for a week out of the entire season! Expect to read blog posts about my experience with that as well.

All in all, this year will mostly be about me trying to be more independent and self sustainable. It is about time that I move out of my parent’s house and get my own place. Before I can do that I will need to secure a higher paying job. There is also the problem of student loan debt. In this current moment I owe around $20,000 of federal student loans. I plan to crush this by the end of the year. This will only be possible through budgeting.

Thank you for reading my posts and supporting me in whatever way you can. I know made TLOJ for myself but I hope that I might be inspiring or helping others out there who might find themselves in a similar situation.
