# TSLA Barefoot Shoes Review

TSLA Barefoot Shoes Review! The TSLA Men’s Trail Running Minimalist Barefoot Shoes were a great purchase for me. I got these shoes off of Amazon [here](https://amzn.to/2xnNxNP). I have had these since February and these are my second pair of barefoot shoes. Let me tell you, I have been wearing these shoes every day of my life. I have been walking and running in them regularly since February.

One thing about these shoes that I love is how light and flexible they are. These shoes are so flexible that I can literally fold the shoe in half and store them in my pocket. The shoes are not the best of quality but for the price, it is definitely worth it. They are semi durable and very stylish.

My first pair of barefoot shoes were the Skinners minimalist sock shoes. I have a review for those shoes on my youtube channel as well. You can find that [here](https://youtu.be/_O1BZg4WEOY). When I compare these shoes to the Skinner’s barefoot sock shoes I would say I prefer the TSLA Men’s Trail minimalist barefoot shoes. With the Skinner’s barefoot sock shoe you can feel a lot more since the sock shoes do not have a sole. With Skinners, you have a lot more control of your feet.

One of the reasons why I prefer TSLA Men’s Trail Running Minimalist Barefoot Shoe over Skinners is that my foot gets really hot, really fast in Skinners. I think this is because Skinners are not as breathable. As soon as you start walking, your feet start to sweat. My feet in the TSLA Men’s Trail Running Minimalist Barefoot Shoe do not get as sweaty. Also, the shoes does not stick to the bottom of my feet as much.

So far I am loving the TSLA Men’s Trail Running Minimalist Barefoot Shoes more than Skinners. With the Skinners you can feel more of the ground with your feet since there is a lot less padding but this is not always a good thing. Walking on pavement with the TSLA Men’s Trail Running Minimalist Barefoot Shoe feels so much better because of the padding.

For example, if you were to step on a rock with the TSLA barefoot shoes it would not be the end of the world. You would still feel it but it’s bearable. Stepping on a medium sized pebble with Skinner’s is the equivalent to stepping on a lego while barefoot.. With my old barefoot shoes I would try to avoid walking on the pavement, now with my TSLA, I don’t mind. I still try to forgo walking on concrete. Whenever I get the chance I walk in the grass. It feels so much nicer. These shoes are really good for running or walking in day-to-day life.
