# My First Experience With a Gun

Let’s talk about my first experience with a gun.

This week was exciting! Going to the gun range has been on my bucket list of things to do for a long time. I am so glad that I had an opportunity to go to the Philly Gun Range in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was a pleasant experience and I plan to go back there sometime in the future.

Growing up, guns were never a topic of discussion in my family. My family were not hunters, policemen, military or anything of that nature. In fact, I never even knew where they stood at in their attitudes towards guns until I told them that I wanted to get into hunting. That is when I found out that both of my parents do not like guns, at all. I invited them to come with me to Philly Gun Range but they declined my invitation.

My father’s reasoning was that he did not like the harm it can cause and how intimidating being around one is. My mother’s reasoning was that her aunt was killed by a gun while out on a hunting trip when she was younger. Both reasons are valid in my eyes as I could understand where they were coming from, but I wanted to be different. I wanted my first experience with a gun to be different.

I wanted to get over the intimidation I felt whenever I saw a gun. To do this I had to get some experience with one. I chose the Philly Gun Range as it is close to me and the prices are not bad. It is 65 dollars for a gun rental, ammunition, a training class, and a spot on the range. The people there were friendly too.

In the training class they went over how to properly hold a pistol and the basic rules and gun manners one should have. For example, how one should never point a gun at anyone else under any circumstances (almost accidentally did this a few times). Also, they went over how one should load a magazine. Holy crap man, I had no clue it was so difficult. If you have ever watched a modern war movie where they have an infantryman trying to feed bullets into a magazine pay attention, because that is a skill.

The gun we were using is a Ruger SR22, a pistol that uses .22 caliber rounds. My girlfriend and I decided to go with this caliber because we had never experienced recoil before and did not want the gun going crazy. I chose the Ruger SR22 only because it looked cool. In hindsight I am glad I went with this pistol. The magazine has some sort of pull down that makes loading rounds into it a lot easier!

The first thing I noticed was that it is incredibly difficult to aim at a target that is any reasonable distance away from you. This is going to sound dumb but I thought aiming would be easier then what I experienced. No one told me how difficult it would be, and even if they did I do not think I would have understood just how difficult it is just from someone telling me. You have to focus on something the size of the tip of a pen to try to hit a target, accurately, that is somewhere off in the distance. I remember being frustrated that my shots were going everywhere except where I wanted it to go.

Another thing I noticed was how loud the sound of gunfire is. I can not emphasize this enough but it is so loud! I find it hard to describe but you can feel the force of each gunshot hit you. It is almost like being at a concert but instead of hearing something nice, you hear the same “pop pop” over and over again. There is no way I could imagine being in there without protective gear for my ears.

Overall, my first experience with a gun was very positive. When I was leaving the gun range I felt that I had a newfound respect for guns and gun owners. I was intimidated walking in but felt a lot more confident walking out. I was over my fear just like that and now I wanted to own one for myself. My plan is to purchase a rifle and a pistol in the near future, so I can have something to take next time I go. Next on my list of things to do is archery. Keep an eye out for my next blog post!
