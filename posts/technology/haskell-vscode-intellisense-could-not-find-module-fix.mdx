# Haskell - VSCode Intellisense Could Not Find Module Fix

I assume you are here because your vscode intellisense is not picking on modules installed by stack. To fix this you need to use [Implicit hie](https://github.com/Avi-D-coder/implicit-hie). Here are the steps I followed to fix my issue

In the root directory of your haskell project run

```bash
stack install implicit-hie
gen-hie > hie.yaml
```

Reload file and everything should be good to go.

export default ({ children }) => <BlogLayout meta={meta}>{children}</BlogLayout>
